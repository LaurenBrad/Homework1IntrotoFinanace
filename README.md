## Overview and Origin
Founded by Ken Howery, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin Peter Theil and Elon Musk, PayPal started in 1998 originally named Confinity. The company first developed security software for handheld devices. However due to no success with that business model, switched its focus to a digital wallet.
PayPal started as a way to send payments via email. Most payments before this service were made by checks and money order sent through U.S. mail. Early on, PayPal joined the eBay family and became the sites official payment provider, making it easy for merchants and buyers to make payemnts without the use of credit cards. In 2002 PayPal went public and generated over $61 million. PayPal is currently valued over $300 billion.



## Business Activities

By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal platform is empowering more than 375 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy. 
PayPal offers products to both individuals and businesses alike, including online vendors, auction sites and corporate users. PayPal again tweaked their business model by starting a new nusiness unit called Merchant Services. Thus providing payment solutions to both small and alrge e-commerce merhants. PayPal was able to lower transaction fees and launch PayPal Mobile so users can pay via text. 



## Landscape

PayPal is in the Payments & Remttances domain in FinTech. Other major companies in this domain include Zelle, Android Pay, Square and ApplePay. In their 22 years in business, PayPal expanded their Commerce Platform services. They also announced a landmark partnership agreement with Visa Inc. to expand consumer choice in payments. PayPal has also forged more than 40 strategic partnerships, including with leading banks like Bank of America Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, card networks and issuers like American Express, Discover, Mastercard and other strategic financial institution partners like Synchrony. The PayPal family now includes PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products.
        



## Results

PayPal has been successful in its objective to make payments easier between consumers and businesses. In the last 22 years PayPal has made many milestones such as now offering buy-hold-sell expericence for cryptocurrency, became the first foreign payment platform to provide online payment services in China, and QR code acceptance. 



## Recommendations

I think PayPal should offer more options to buy different cryptocurrencies. Currently you can only buy or sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on PayPal. Another serivce it to have the option to pay in person using their app. 
Paypal offering more options for in store/in person purchasing. Some big retail stores have PayPal as a payment option but mainly for online purchases. The current techonology PayPal uses for its mobile app would be appropriate to offer in person purchase by using their current QR code acceptance.
